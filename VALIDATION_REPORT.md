## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Demonstrate the analytical pipeline (not true validation) for the Han 2012 survival nomogram and heuristic recurrence model on TCGA gastric adenocarcinoma cohort with fully imputed surgical variables.  
**Cohort:** TCGA PanCanAtlas stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), n=436, enriched for advanced stages.  
**Models:** Han 2012 Cox survival nomogram (baseline survival estimated); heuristic logistic recurrence model (KLASS-inspired).  

**Key Findings (post-baseline recalibration):**
- Mean 5-year survival prediction: ~80% (Han 2012) with prognosis categories balanced (~33% Excellent, ~56% Good/Moderate).
- Recurrence model Brier score vs. disease-free status: 0.502 (demonstrates endpoint mismatch; not interpretable as calibration due to 100% imputation).
- High-risk distribution: median recurrence risk 86.6%; 77% classified Very High Risk (reflects advanced cohort).
- Correlation (recurrence vs. survival): r ≈ -0.456 (moderate inverse relationship).

**Limitations:**
- 100% variable imputation (tumor location, size, positive/total LN counts) from stage priors; precludes external calibration validity.
- Outcome mismatch for recurrence model (disease-free survival vs. recurrence).
- Baseline survival for Han 2012 model estimated, not published.
- Non-representative cohort (genomic selection bias; incomplete follow-up detail).

**Conclusion:** The TCGA run is a pipeline demonstration illustrating harmonization, dual-model execution, and diagnostic tooling; it should not be interpreted as external validation until applied to a cohort with measured surgical variables and aligned endpoints.

## Methods Overview

- **Design:** Pipeline demonstration on retrospective genomic cohort (TCGA STAD, 2018 release); unsuitable for true external validation because surgical predictors are fully imputed.
- **Predictors:** TNM stage, age, sex; deterministic imputation for tumor size/location and LN metrics when missing.
- **Outcomes:** Disease-free status (proxy) for recurrence calibration; survival predictions are model-generated using estimated S₀(t) values (S₅=0.52, S₁₀=0.43).
- **Performance Metrics:** Risk distribution summaries, Brier score vs. DFS, prognosis category counts, correlation between recurrence and survival outputs. Time-to-event calibration not assessed (DFS/OS not available with full timelines).
- **Software:** `risk_calculator.py` (dual-model pipeline), Matplotlib visualizations; reproducible via `python3 risk_calculator.py --data data/tcga_2018_clinical_data.tsv`.

## Sensitivity Analysis: Lymph Node Yield

### Clinical Motivation

Adequate lymph node harvest is critical for accurate gastric cancer staging (Will Rogers phenomenon). Insufficient lymphadenectomy leads to stage migration, underestimated recurrence risk, and potential undertreatment.

### Methodological Approach

- **Test Case:** T2N1 patient with 3 positive nodes (fixed).  
- **Variable:** Total lymph nodes examined (10–40).  
- **Metric:** Predicted 5-year recurrence risk (heuristic model).

### Results

| LN Yield | LN Ratio | Predicted Risk | Change from Baseline |
|----------|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| 10 | 0.30 | 73.3% | Reference |
| 15 | 0.20 | 68.4% | -4.9% |
| 20 | 0.15 | 65.7% | -7.6% |
| 25 | 0.12 | 64.1% | -9.2% |
| 30 | 0.10 | 62.9% | -10.4% |
| 35 | 0.086 | 62.1% | -11.2% |
| 40 | 0.075 | 61.5% | -11.8% |

### Clinical Implications

1. Inadequate dissection penalty: 10 vs. 30 nodes → ~10% absolute risk difference.  
2. Diminishing returns beyond ~25–30 nodes.  
3. D2 standard: AJCC/NCCN recommend ≥16 nodes examined; >25 improves prognostic confidence.

### Model Behavior

The model penalizes inadequate lymph node harvest via the LN ratio term:

```
logit(p) = ... + 2.4 × (positive_LN / total_LN)
```

Lower denominator (inadequate harvest) → Higher ratio → Higher predicted risk.

### Limitations of This Analysis

- Assumes positive node count fixed (clinical scenarios may vary).  
- Does not model stage migration explicitly.  
- Ignores nodal basin distribution (D1 vs. D2 dissection).

### Recommended Quality Metric

Audit LN yield as a surgical quality indicator:
- Target: ≥80% of cases with ≥16 nodes examined.
- Best practice: ≥25 nodes for accurate prognostication.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Re-estimate S₀(t) using local time-to-event data; report calibration plots with confidence intervals.  
2. Replace deterministic imputation with multiple imputation or exclude cases with missing surgical variables when possible.  
3. Collect prospective cohort with standardized recurrence endpoints to reassess Brier score and discrimination (C-index).  
4. Document full TRIPOD item compliance with uncertainty estimates once time-to-event data are available.
